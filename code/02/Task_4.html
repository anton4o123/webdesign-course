		<h1><em>Why I'm doing this homework?</em></h1>
		<p>I'm doing my homework for webdesign because I need to study <a href=http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML>html!</a></p>
		
		<h2><dl>Why I need to know html?</dl></h2>
		<p>I need to know html because I'm a programmer and knowing of html is a plus!</p>
		<p>When you know html you can create ruby parser which can remove advetisements from a page.</p>
		<p>This will allow you to have more small pages and only text which you can read easy.</p>
		
		<h2><dt>What's important in html?</dt></h2>
		<p>In html you need to know how to use tags and the structure of a page.</p>
		<p>The structure of the page has a head tag and body tag.</p>
		<p>But the most important tag is the html tag which signalizes an html document!!!</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Ubuntu 12.04 features Unity, a completely reimagined user interface. Unity is designed to minimize distractions, give you more room to work, and help you get things done.
			</li>
				This guide is designed to answer your questions about using Unity and your Ubuntu desktop. First we will take a moment to look at some Unity's key features, and how you can use them.
			<li>
				The Launcher appears automatically when you log in to your desktop, and gives you quick access to the applications you use most often.
			</li>
				The Ubuntu Button sits near the top left corner of the screen and is always the top item in the launcher. If you click the Ubuntu Button, Unity will present you with an additional feature of the desktop, the Dash.
			<li>
				The Dash also gives you shortcuts to often-used Internet, photo, email, and music applications.
